"""Client fingerprint filter - identifies clients by HTTP characteristics.

Since ASGI servers don't expose raw TLS ClientHello data (needed for
true JA3 hashing), this filter uses observable HTTP-layer signals as a
composite fingerprint:

  1. Header ordering hash - browsers have consistent header ordering
     that differs from CLI tools, bots, and scanners.
  2. Known scanner fingerprints - blocklist of header-order hashes for
     common offensive/defensive tools.
  3. Header presence anomalies - missing or unusual header combinations
     that indicate non-browser clients.

Operators can configure:
  - ``allowed_fingerprints``: Hashes of expected beacon header orders
    (allowlist - bypasses this filter entirely).
  - ``blocked_fingerprints``: Additional hashes to block.

The fingerprint hash is computed as:
  sha256(sorted_lower_header_names joined by ",")

This is a best-effort heuristic. For true JA3 filtering, deploy a
TLS-terminating proxy (e.g., nginx with ja3 module) in front of
InfraGuard and pass the JA3 hash as an X-JA3-Hash header.
